# Training for the final project
The course introduces the fundamentals of semantic modelling and the different languages that the World Wide Web Committee recommends for expressing semantic models and ontologies. 

In particular, the languages **RDF, RDF with datatype, RDF with RDF vocabulary, RDF Schema, OWL 2 DL and OWL 2 Full** are used throughout the entire course. 

For accessing and manipulating ontologies, the **Protege tool** and the **SPARQL language** are presented. 

Of each language, the inferential relationship, and the computational complexity of the related problems are discussed. 

A software architecture for the implementation of knowledge-based systems that adopt Semantic Web languages is presented and used to illustrate the notions presented.
